# Spherical Snake

A project for Dr. Stephen Guy's class **Game Engine Technologies**.

Our directive was to make something cool by writing our own shaders. I decided to overhaul the visuals of a game I had made previously.

## About

Spherical Snake is a game I have been working on for the past few months in my spare time. It is a variant of the classic computer game "Snake" played on a spherical world. I hope to release it as a mobile game eventually. Until recently, however, the visuals left much to be desired.

## Source Code

I am making the game in the [Unity](https://unity.com/) engine. I used [Amplify Shader Editor](http://amplify.pt/unity/amplify-shader-editor/) to create the shaders.

I made all of the 3D models myself except for the bottle and barrel which are by [Ajay Karat](http://www.procjam.com/art/devil.html), and the rocks which are by [John Gillessen](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/peacefull-place-f755bba1783e4109b8037f4b56b56fb6).

The source code (current as of 13/11/2019) is available to download [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15e5d5eMOY7Mnlr6pb9vtDpczVOlYjQ4Q?usp=sharing).
