## Hey there,

I'm Tien!

I'm a senior studying Computer Science with a focus on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Minnesota.

During my college career, I have worked with [Dr. Stephen J. Guy](https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~sjguy/) in Applied Motion Lab, where we developed a deep 

learning model to categorize legitimate and voluntary smiles from videos. Right now I'm working with Professor Aaron Kerlin in the

[Kerlin Lab](https://kerlinlab.org/) as a software developer, I'm working on developing custom software for the FLIR cameras which allow

researchers to take pictures of living cells. I am also a teaching assistant in the Computer Science department for [Machine Architecture and Organization](https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kauffman/2021/).
