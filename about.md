## Hey there,

I'm Tien!

I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at DraftKings.

I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities on December 2020.

During my college career, I have worked with [Dr. Stephen J. Guy](https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~sjguy/) in Applied Motion Lab, where we developed a deep 
learning model to categorize legitimate and voluntary smiles from videos.

I also worked with Professor Aaron Kerlin in [Kerlin Lab](https://kerlinlab.org/) as a software developer, 
developing deep learning projects using [DeepLabCut](http://www.mousemotorlab.org/deeplabcut).

In summer 2020, I interned at [Veritas](https://www.veritas.com/) as a DevOps developer. My team worked on
integrating [Google's AddressSanitizer](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer) to
build and test pipeline of [NetBackup](https://www.veritas.com/protection/netbackup). This tool is now
being used in production to automatically detect memory-related issues.

I am also a teaching assistant in the Computer Science department for
[Machine Architecture and Organization](https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kauffman/2021/).

An updated version of my resume can be found [here](/tiendinh.pdf)

I also earned a Computer Vision Nanodegree from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), check it out [here](https://graduation.udacity.com/confirm/CDC2RU6P).
