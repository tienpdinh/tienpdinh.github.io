## Hey there,

I'm Dan!

I'm interested in technology and art, which has led me to study computer graphics.

I graduated in December 2019 with a B.S. in computer science. I am currently pursuing an M.S. in computer science at the University of Minnesota.

I also work as a computer science teaching assistant and at [AISOS](http://aisos.umn.edu/), where I help build informative digital experiences.

In my spare time I like to read, draw, play games, listen to podcasts, and spend time with my friends and family.

My resume is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pAoeWMVmRG-uOplchmDD8qh1SfPuwfCJ26882EFppic/edit?usp=sharing).
