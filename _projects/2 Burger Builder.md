# Order a Burger
In this project, I used React to create a static website that allows users to
build a burger of their choice for a React class that I am taking.

**The application is live, you can check it out [here](https://tienpdinh.com/burger)**

**The application is also customized for mobile devices, and it might look better on a
mobile device.**

## Media

> A burger built with my app.

## Development
This is a work in progress, I will add more features to the app gradually. I will
also demonstrate the use of version control (branching) to practice real development
cycle.

You can suggest new feature by raising in issue [here](https://github.com/tienpdinh/burger/issues).
