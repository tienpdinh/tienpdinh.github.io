## About

TinyPaint is a lightweight painting and image-editing application for MacOS and Linux systems.

I made it to familiarize myself with user interface programming. I wrote it in C, used Gtk for the user interface, and OpenGL to render the canvas.

Currently it features 6 different tools, 10 different filters, undo/redo history, and saving/loading `.png` images.

For installation and usage instructions, please visit the [Github page](https://github.com/danielshervheim/TinyPaint){:target="_blank"}.
