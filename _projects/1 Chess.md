# Chess

A project for Dr. Stephen Guy's class **Game Engine Technologies**. My classmate [Daniel Shervheim](https://danielshervheim.com/) and I collaborated on this project..

Our directive was to create a game in a provided game engine, using only Lua scripting. Additionally, our game had to demonstrate some form of animation. We chose to create a chess game.

## Technical Reports

## Source Code

The source code is available to download [here](https://github.com/tienpdinh/3D-Chess).

We also ported an [open source easing library](https://github.com/nicolausYes/easing-functions/blob/master/src/easing.cpp) to Lua for use in our project.
