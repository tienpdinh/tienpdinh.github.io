> 3D Birds Flocking around 3 pillars

## Features
- 3D animations
- Boids local navigation
- Multiple obstacles avoidance

## Additional Information
- I have found out that without the right set of parameters for
each individual forces such as alignment, cohesion and separation,
the simulation would break completely.

## Source Code
I implemented my flocking simulation in Processing, the source code can be found [here](https://github.com/tienpdinh/Flocking).
