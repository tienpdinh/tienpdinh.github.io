# Realtime Calculator
This is a coding challenge. My directive was to implement a web app
that record and report calculations from users in real-time.

## Run the App
* This web app is live, you can check it out [here](https://tienpdinh.com/calculator/)
* This app supports and looks better on mobile devices.

## Features
* Basic calculations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
* All calculations will be logged onto the database.
* Each time a user log a calculation, it will be reported in real-time to other users
who are connecting to the website.

## Technologies Used
I decided to implement this web app in [React](https://reactjs.org/)
because I recently learned React and I thought this is the perfect
opportunity for me to apply what I have learned the past few weeks.

To reduce the amount of CSS I have to write to customize the look
of the app, I decided to use [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/).
This is the first time I got exposed to Bootstrap so there was a little
bit of learning but I was able to use it properly in my application.

I deployed the app to [Github](https://github.com) using
[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Github Pages provides free
web hosting and they also have free SSL certificate so I decided to
go with them.

The last technology that I used was [Firebase Server](https://firebase.google.com/).
Firebase provides a real-time database and this is the perfect type
of database for my web app.

## Challenges
All of these technologies are still somewhat new to me. I only started
making website a few weeks ago, and Firebase as well as Bootstrap are
completely new to me. Thankfully, I am a fast learner so I was able to
pull it off with no problem.

## Future Developments
In the future, I plan to add more features to the web app such as integrating
[Wolfram API](http://products.wolframalpha.com/api/) to do even more than
just plain calculations. I would also add CSS animations to make the app
looks more natural.
